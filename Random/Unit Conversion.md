To convert between units, first identify what your starting and ending units are. For example, let's say we have 352 feet per second, which we write as $\frac{352\ feet}{1\ sec}$, and we want to convert this to $\frac{miles}{hour}$. We have identified our starting and ending units, so we can move on.

The next step is to identify what conversions will be needed. In this case, we need to convert feet to miles, as well as seconds to hours. There are 5280 feet in one mile, which we write as $\frac{5280\ feet}{1\ mile}$. However, it is equally correct to say that 1 mile is made up of 5280 feet, which we write as $\frac{1\ mile}{5280\ feet}$. Because feet is the unit in the numerator of our starting value, we want to use $\frac{1\ mile}{5280\ feet}$ for our conversion, as putting feet in the denominator will cause the units to cancel out, leaving us with miles.

There are 60 seconds in 1 hour, which we write as $\frac{60\ sec}{1\ hour}$. These are all of the conversions we need for this example, so we can move on.

Finally, we convert from our starting units to our ending units. We do this by multiplying our starting value by our conversion factors. Units in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out as we multiply along, which will ultimately result in our desired ending units:
$$\begin{align*}
	\frac{352\ \cancel{feet}}{1\ \bcancel{sec}} \times \frac{1\ mile}{5280\ \cancel{feet}} \times \frac{60\ \bcancel{sec}}{1\ hour} &= \frac{21120\ miles}{5280\ hours}
\end{align*}$$
However, we often want to simplify our denominator to be $1$ of whatever unit we are looking for. So, if we simplify, we have $\frac{21120\ miles}{5280\ hours} = \frac{4\ miles}{1\ hour}$, which is the desired result.



### Example: Nail polish remover containing acetone was spilled in a room 6m x 5m x 3m. Measurements indicated that 3600mg of acetone evaporated. Calculate the acetone concentration in micrograms per cubic meter.

Let's start with what we know. We have $6\times5\times3=90$ cubic meters, and $3600$ milligrams. This means the current acetone concentration is $\frac{3600\ mg}{90\ m^3}$.

Our area is already in cubic meters, so we don't need to change the units there. We do, however, need to convert milligrams to micrograms. There are $1000$ micrograms in $1$ milligram, so the conversion rate is $\frac{1000\ mcg}{1\ mg}$. So, we multiply to convert: $\frac{3600\ mg}{90\ m^{3}}\times\frac{1000\ mcg}{1\ mg}=\frac{3600000\ mcg}{90\ m^{3}}$.

Simplifying, we reach the final answer of $\frac{40000\ mcg}{1\ m^{3}}$.
