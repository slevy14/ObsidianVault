## Propositional Functions
>[!INFO] Defnition 1.3.1
>**Propositional Functions** are propositions with inputs.
>
>Denoted $P(x)$.

For example, if a proposition $P(x):\ x<5$, then $P(3)$ is *true* and $P(5)$ is *false*.

**Propositional Functions** can also have multiple variables
	Ex: $P(x, y):\ x+y > 2$, $P(3,4)$ is *true*.

## Quantification
### Universal
>[!INFO] Definition 1.3.2
>The **Universal Quantification** of $P(x)$ is "$P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain".
>
>Denoted $\forall x P(x)$

The **Universal Quantification** is true if the proposition is true for every $x$, and is otherwise false.
	Ex: $P(x):\ x^{2} \geq 0$, $\forall x P(x)$ is *true* because $x^{2} \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Ex: $P(x):\ x+2>0$, $\forall x P(x)$ is *false* for $\mathbb{R}$, as $P(-3)$ is *false*.

### Existential
>[!INFO] Definition 1.3.3
>The **Existential Quantification** of $P(x)$ is "there exists an element $x$ in the domain such that $P(x) is true$".
>
>Denoted $\exists x P(x)$

The **Existential Quantification** is true if the proposition is true for an $x$, and is otherwise false.
	Ex: $P(x):\ x^{2} < 0$, $\exists x P(x)$ is *false* on $\mathbb{R}$, but *true* on $\mathbb{C}$ ($P(i)=i^2<0$).

>[!EXAMPLE] Example 1.3.1
>1. **"Every student in this class loves apples."**
>	- $P(x)$ is "$x$ loves apples", the domain is students in the class
>	- Statement can be written $\forall x P(x)$
>	- Negation: "There is a student in this class that does not love apples"
>		- Can be written $\exists x \neg P(x)$
>
>2. **"There is a student in this class that prefers remote learning."**
>	- $\exists x P(x)$
>	- Negation: "No student in this class prefers remote learning"
>		- Can be written $\forall x \neg P(x)$

## Negations

| Statement             | Equivalent            | When True?                            | When False?                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $\neg \forall x P(x)$ | $\exists x \neg P(x)$ | There is an $x$ where $P(x)$ is false | $P(x)$ is true for every x   |
| $\neg \exists x P(x)$ | $\forall x \neg P(x)$ | For every $x$, $P(x)$ is false        | There is an $x$ where $P(x)$ true| 

## Examples with Changing Domain
Problems like this appeared in the homework -- how does the logical statement change if the domain changes?

>[!EXAMPLE] Example 1.3.2
>**Translate the following into logical expressions. First, let the domain be students in this class, then let it be all people.**
>
>1. "Everyone in class is friendly"
>	- $F(x)=$ "$x$ is friendly"
>		- $\forall x F(x)$
>	- $C(x)=$ "$x$ is in this class"
>		- $\forall x (C(x)\rightarrow F(x))$
>
>2. "A student in this class has been in a movie"
>	- $M(x)=$ "$x$ has been in a movie"
>		- $\exists x M(x)$
>	- $C(x)=$ "$x$ is in this class"
>		- $\exists x (C(x)\wedge M(x))$
>
>3. "There is a student in this class not born in california"
>	- $B(x)=$ "$x$ was born in California"
>		- $\exists x (\neg B(x))$
>	- $C(x)=$ "$x$ is in this class"
>		- $\exists x (C(x)\wedge \neg B(x))$
