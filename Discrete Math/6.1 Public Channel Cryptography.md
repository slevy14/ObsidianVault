## Perfect Codes
>[!INFO] Definition 6.1.1
>**Graph:** A collection of points (**vertices**) and segments connecting pairs of vertices (**edges**). There are no loops, or more than one edge connecting a pair of vertices. If two vertices are connected by an edge, they are **adjacent**. The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges going into it.

For example, let's look at graph $G$:
![[graph_1.png]]
In this graph, we have **vertices** $\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I\}$ and **edges** $\{HI,IC,ID,CB,\dots\}$. Two graphs are the same if they have the same vertices and edges.

>[!INFO] Definition 6.1.2
>**Perfect Code:** The **perfect code** of a graph $G$ is the set of vertices $V_{pc}$ with the following properties:
>- None of the vertices in $V_{pc}$ are adjacent,
>- Every vertex in $G$ that is not in $V_{pc}$ must be adjacent to exactly one vertex in $V_{pc}$.

>[!EXAMPLE] Example 6.1.1
>**Find the perfect code in the following graph.**
>
>![[graph_2.png]]
>We can see that the perfect code here is $V_{pc}=\{E,I\}$, as they are the two vertices that connect to all other vertices without any overlap or missing vertices.

A graph can have multiple perfect codes.

To make a graph from a perfect code, we start by connecting the vertices $V_{pc}$ to all other vertices. Then, we connect the other vertices randomly to each other.

For cryptography, I would start with a perfect code that only I know, and build a perfect code around it. I would keep the perfect code secret, but make the completed graph available to the public.

The following example breaks down the process needed to encrypt and decrypt messages using the clumping method.

>[!EXAMPLE] Example 6.1.2
>**Alice wants to send Bob the number 17. How would she send it, and how would he decrypt it?**
>
>Alice would start by encrypting the number 17 onto Bob's public graph. She does this by assigning each vertex with a value such that the sum of all vertices is 17:
>![[graph_3a.png]]
>Next, she **clumps** the numbers by assigning to each vertex the sum of itself and its adjacent vertices, and sends Bob the clumped graph:
>![[graph_3b.png]]
>Now that the graph is encrypted (the total sum is now 46), Bob can decrypt it using the perfect code, which is represented by the shaded vertices. The sum of the perfect code in the clumped graphis $-3+20=17$, so Bob knows that the encrypted message is $17$.

>Here is a proof for why the clumping method works in this example, although it can be generalized for all perfect codes:
>>[!EXAMPLE] Proof
>>Start with the graph:
>>![[graph_4.png]]
>>where $V_{pc}=\{F,I\}$. Let $x_{A},x_{B},\dots,x_{I}$ be the numbers Alice originally writes on the graph, with $x_{A}+x_{B}+\cdots+x_{I}=17$. Let $y_{A}, y_{B},\dots,y_{I}$ be the clumped numbers she sends to Bob, e.g., $y_{D}=x_{D}+x_{I}$. We have $y_{F}=x_{F}+x_{A}+x_{B}+x_{C}$ and $y_{I}=x_{I}+x_{D}+x_{E}+x_{G}+x_{H}$. Thus, we have $y_{F}+y_{I}=x_{A}+x_{B}+\cdots+x_{I}=17$. $\square$

In these examples, the graph is very small, so it is easy to find the perfect code. In general, however, these graphs are verly large, and it is incredibly difficult to find the perfect code by brute force if you don't already know it.

## Primes
Recall that $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{>1}$ is prime iff whenever $p|ab$, then $p|a$ or $p|b$. In general, moving forwards, $p$ represents a prime number.

>[!ABSTRACT] Proposition
>**If $ab \equiv cb \pmod{p}$ and $p \nmid b$, then $a \equiv c \pmod{p}$ where $p$ is prime.**
>
>>[!EXAMPLE] Proof
>>Suppose $ab \equiv cb \pmod{p}$ and $p \nmid b$. We have $p|(ab-cb)$, i.e., $p|(a-c)b$. Since $p$ is prime, $p|(a-c)$ or $p|b$. As $p \nmid b$, we have $p|(a-c)$, i.e., $a \equiv c \pmod{p}$. $\square$

### Fermat's Little Theorem
>[!ABSTRACT] Fermat's Little Theorem ($FlT$)
>**Let $p$ be prime. If $p \nmid a$, then $a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.**
>
>>[!EXAMPLE] Proof
>>Consider the sets $\{1,2,\dots,p-1\}$ and $\{a,2a,\dots,(p-1)a\}$. We will claim that these are the same set $\pmod p$. By reducing each set by $\pmod p$, we find $\{[a]_{p},[2a]_{p},\dots,[(p-1)a]_{p}\}\subseteq\{[1]_{p},[2]_{p},\dots,[p-1]_{p}\}$. The second set has $p-1$ elements; thus, if both sets have the same number of elements, they must be the same set. If $[ja]_{p}=[ka]_{p}$ with $1 \leq j$ and $k \leq p-1$, then $[ja-ka]_{p}=[0]_{p}$. This means $ja \equiv ka \pmod p$. As $p \nmid a$, we have $j \equiv k \pmod{p}$, so $j=k$. Thus, all elements in $\{[a]_{p},[2a]_{p},\dots,[(p-1)a]_{p}\}$ are distinct. We have found our claim to be true. Thus, $[a]_{p}[2a]_{p}\cdots[(p-1)a]_{p}=[1]_{p}[2]_{p}\cdots[p-1]_{p}$. So, we have $[a^{p-1}]_{p}[(p-1)!]_{p}=[(p-1)!]_{p}$. We know $gcd((p-1)!, 1)=1$, so we know that $[(p-1)!]_{p}^{-1}$ exists. Multiplying both sides by the inverse gives us $[a^{p-1}]_{p}=[1]_{p}$, i.e., $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. $\square$

For this class, this has only been useful a select couple of times, but notably to prove the RSA theorem.

## Euler's Totient
This function is critical for **RSA Encryption**, as well as other forms of encryption.
>[!INFO] Definition 6.1.3
>**Euler's Totient Function:** Given $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{>1}$, we define $\varphi(m)=\#\{a\in \mathbb{Z} \text{ with } 1 \leq a \leq m, gcd(a,m)=1\}$.

**Euler's Totient** gives us the amount of numbers that are relatively prime to $m$. For example, $\varphi(4)=\#\{1,3\}=2$, $\varphi(6)=\#\{1,5\}=2$, $\varphi(8)=\#\{1,3,5,7\}=4$, $\varphi(7)=\#\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}=6$.

>[!TIP] For $p$ prime, $\varphi(p)=p-1$.

>[!EXAMPLE] Example 6.1.3
>**Calculate $\varphi(15)=\varphi(3\cdot5)$.**
>
>$\varphi(15)=\#\{1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\}=8$.
>
>Observe $\varphi(3)=\#\{1,2\}=2$ and $\varphi(5)=\#\{1,2,3,4\}=4$, which gives us $\varphi(3 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 = \varphi(15)$.

From this example, we can observe that $\varphi(3 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 4 = (3-1)(5-1)$. From here, we can conjecture that this is applicable to all primes.

>[!ABSTRACT] Conjecture
>**For primes $p,q$, we have $\varphi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)=pq-p-q+1$.**
